NYT Best Sellers and Go

Exploratory for now
Trying to brush up on my Go skills

Future...

- connect with a db
- connect with an llm
- maybe make a cli?

To run

1. download go
2. clone repo
3. `cd bestsellers`
4. `go run main.go`

Or you can use a number of online go [playgrounds](https://play.golang.org/)
